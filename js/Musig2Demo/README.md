```

### Mast

**generateThresholdPubkey(pubkeys, threshold, network)**

```java
Generate threshold signature addresses by passing in 
all signer public keys and signature thresholds.
network: "mainnet", "signet", "testnet".
Returns: <String>
Return the public key of the threshold-signature address.
Possible error string returned is `Invalid Public Bytes`.
```
**generateControlBlock(pubkeys, threshold, aggPubkey)**
```java
Generate a proof of the aggregated public key by 
passing in the public key and signature threshold of 
all signers and the aggregated public key of everyone 
who performed the signature this time.
Returns: <String>
Return signed proofs for transaction validation.
Possible error string returned is `Invalid Public Bytes`.
```

# Example

The specific usage can be viewed in [musig2.js](src/musig2.js).These examples simulate three people generating aggregated public keys and aggregated signatures.

## Detail

### Construct Tx

There are two types of construction transactions, one is the transaction that is spent on constructing a common bench32m address, and the other is the transaction that is spent on constructing the threshold address generated by the following mast (also the address encoded by the bench32m, which cannot be distinguished from the common bench32m address by the naked eye). Constructing a transaction is divided into the following steps:

1. **Pass in the input and output list to construct the initial transaction**. txids and indexes represent input, and must correspond one-to-one. Addresses and amounts represent output, and they must also correspond one-to-one. Note that the output here supports **op_return**, just set amout to 0 and address to the information you want to attach.

   ~~~js
   let tx = generateRawTx(txids, indexs, addresses, amounts);
   ~~~

2. For each of the above inputs, a corresponding signature is required to be spent, but sighash needs to be generated before signing (that is, a message waiting for signature). When using the **getSighash** function, you need to pay attention to the following: each input cost address corresponding to txid+index must be calculated and signed once by sighash; When the input cost address is normal taproot address, `agg_pubkey` is `""`, `sigversion` is `0` ; When the input cost address is threshold address, `agg_pubkey` is the same as the `agg_pubkey` parameter of `generateControlBlock` in mast, and `sigversion` is `1`;

   input address: normal taproot address

   ~~~js
   let sighash = getSighash(prev_tx, tx, 0,  "", 0);
   ~~~

   input address:threshold address

   ~~~js
   let sighash_1 = getSighash(prev_tx_1, tx_1, 0,  pubkey_bc, 1);
   ~~~

3. For each input, after calculating the sighash, it needs to be signed. For the normal taproot address, use the `generateSchnorrSignature` function to generate the signature and pass the `message` into the sighash; For the taproot address, the following Musig2 multi-party aggregation signature is required, and the signed message must also be passed to the above sighash

   input address: normal taproot address

   ~~~js
   let schnorr_signature = generateSchnorrSignature(sighash, private_char);
   ~~~

   input address:threshold address: Use Musig2

4. For each input, after calculating the signature, it needs to be assembled into the initial transaction. Of course, the taproot address also needs to be calculated by mast and passed in `agg_pubkey` and control_block

   input address: normal taproot address

   ~~~js
   let taproot_tx = buildTaprootTx(tx,  schnorr_signature, 0);
   ~~~

   input address:threshold address: 

   ~~~js
   let threshold_tx = buildThresholdTx(tx_1, multi_signature,  pubkey_bc, control_1, 0);
   ~~~

### Musig2

- First pass in the private key to declare a State pointer and get my pubkey

~~~javascript
let round1StateA = getRound1State()
let pubkeyA = getMyPubkey(privateA)
~~~

- Use State pointer to  round1 message.

~~~javascript
let round1MsgA = getRound1Msg(round1StateA)
~~~

- Round1 state object serialization

~~~javascript
let encodedRound1StateA = encodeRound1State(round1StateA);
~~~

- Round1 state object deserialization

~~~javascript
round1StateA = decodeRound1State(encodedRound1StateA)
~~~

- Pass the self-generated my_pubkey and round1 message to the other two parties, and the other two parties do the same. In the end, I got the public key and round1 message of the other two parties. Pass in the `getRound2Msg` function to generate my own round2 message. 

~~~javascript
let round2MsgA = getRound2Msg(round1StateA, msg, privkeyA, [pubkeyA, pubkeyB, pubkeyC], [round1MsgB, round1MsgC])
~~~

- Pass the round1 message to the other two parties, and I can finally generate the signature by `getAggSignature`. 

~~~javascript
let signature = getAggSignature([round2MsgA, round2MsgB, round2MsgC])
~~~

- When I obtain the public keys of the other two parties, I can generate the aggregate public key. 

~~~javascript
let pubkey = getAggPublicKey([round1MsgA, round1MsgB, round1MsgC])
~~~

### Mast

- The threshold signature address can be generated by using the threshold and the public key of the all participant.

~~~javascript
const threshold_pubkey = generateThresholdPubkey([pubkeya, pubkeyb, pubkeyc], 2, "mainnet");
~~~

- Using the threshold, the public keys of all participants and the aggregation of the public keys can generate a proof.

~~~javascript
const control_block = generateControlBlock( [pubkeya, pubkeyb, pubkeyc], 2, pubkeyab)
~~~
