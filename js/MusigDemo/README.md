# Overview

This is the js version of musig api. Mainly to facilitate the construction of the js version threshold signature wallet.

# Api
Class: Musig(private)
```
Pass in the 32-byte private key string to create the Musig class for multi-signature.
```
- Musig.getMyPubkey()
```javascript
Returns: <string>
Return a 32-byte public key string.
Possible error string returned is `Invalid Secret Bytes`.
```
- Musig.getMyCommit()
```javascript
Returns: <string>
Returns a 16-byte commit string.
Possible error strings returned are `Null Musig` or `Invalid Commit Bytes`.
```
- Musig.getMyReveal([commits], [pubkeys])
```javascript
Pass in the commits and public-keys of other signers.
Returns: <string>
Returns a 96-byte reveal string.
Possible error strings returned are `Null Musig` or `Invalid Reveal Bytes`.
```
- Musig.getMyCosign([reveals], [pubkeys])
```javascript
Pass in the reveals and public-keys of other signers.
Returns: <string>
Returns a 32-byte cosign string.
Possible error strings returned are `Null Musig` or `Invalid Cosign Bytes`.
```
- Musig.getAggSignature([reveals], [pubkeys], [cosigns])
```javascript
Pass in the reveals, public-keys and cosigns of other signers.
Returns: <string>
Returns a 64-byte signature string.
Possible error string returned is `Invalid Signature`.
```
- Musig.getAggPublicKey([pubkeys])
```javascript
Pass in the public-keys to be aggregated.
Returns: <string>
Returns a 32-byte aggregate public-key string.
Possible error strings returned are `Null Musig` or `Invalid Commit Bytes`.
```

# Example

The specific usage can be viewed in [example.js](src/example.js).This example simulates three people generating aggregated public keys and aggregated signatures.

## detail

- First pass in the private key to declare a Musig instance

~~~js
const musig0 = new Musig(private0)
~~~

- Use Musig instance to get my own public key and commit.

~~~js
const pubkey0 = musig0.getMyPubkey()
const commit0 = musig0.getMyCommit()
~~~

- Pass the self-generated pubkey and commit to the other two parties, and the other two parties do the same. In the end, I got the public key and commit of the other two parties. Pass in the `getMyReveal` function to generate my own reveal. **Note that when passing parameters here, pubkey and commit must correspond one to one**.

~~~js
const reveal0 = musig0.getMyReveal([commit1, commit2], [pubkey1, pubkey2])
~~~

- Like commit, pass the reveal and pubkey generated by myself to the other two parties, and I can finally generate the cosign by `getMyCosign`. The pubkey is repeatedly passed here to identify reveal. **Note that when passing parameters here, pubkey and reveal must correspond one to one**.

~~~js
const cosign0 = musig0.getMyCosign([reveal1, reveal2], [pubkey1, pubkey2])
~~~

- Like commit, pass the cosign and pubkey generated by myself to the other two parties, and I can finally generate the signature by `getAggSignature`. **Note that when passing parameters here, reveal, pubkey and reveal must correspond one to one**.

~~~js
const signature = musig0.getAggSignature([reveal0, reveal1, reveal2], [pubkey0, pubkey1, pubkey2], [cosign0, cosign1, cosign2])
~~~

- When I obtain the public keys of the other two parties, I can generate the aggregate public key. **Note that the public key here must be in order, and the incoming order of the `getAggSignature` must be consistent.**

~~~js
const pubkey = musig0.getAggPubkey([pubkey0, pubkey1, pubkey2])
~~~
