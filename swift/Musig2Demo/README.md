# Overview

This is an example of using musig2 as an aar package. Some help for building a threshold signature wallet for Ios.

# Dependencies

Import package

`File>Add Packages>Github` search https://github.com/AAweidai/Musig2, as shown in the figure below. The current version is **1.0.0**.

Step 2. Import
```
import Musig2
```

# Api
### Musig
**getRound1State(private)**

```java
Use privkey to calculate the State of the first round
Returns: State Pointer If the calculation fails just a null pointer will be returned.
```

**getMyPubkey(private)**

```java
Help to get the PublicKey from privkey
Returns: pubkey string Possible errors are Null KeyPair Pointer and Normal Error.
```

**getRound1Msg(state)**

```java
Passed round1 State to generate msg which will broadcast
Returns: msg String. 
Possible errors are Normal Error and Null Round1 State Pointer.
```

**encodeRound1State(state)**

```java
encode State object.
Returns: state String 
Possible error is Null Round1 State Pointer or Encode Fail.
```

**decodeRound1State(round1_state)**

```java
Use string to decode State object.
Returns: State. 
Failure will return a null pointer.
```

**getRound2Msg(state, msg, my_pubkey, pubkeys, received_round1_msg)**

```java
It takes a lot of preparation to switch to round2 state(StatePrime). You need the round1 State, the message to sign for it, your own public key, everyone's public key, and everyone else's msgs from the round1.
Returns: StatePrime Pointer. 
Failure will return a null pointer.
```

**getAggSignature(round2_msg)**

```java
To construct a signature requires the status of the round2 msg about the second round of all other signers, and its own R.
Returns: signature String. 
Possible errors are Normal Error and Null Round2 State Pointer.
```

**getAggPublicKey([pubkeys])**
```java
Pass in the public key to generate the aggregated public key
Returns: pubkey String. 
Possible error is Normal Error.
```

### Mast

**generateThresholdPubkey(pubkeys, threshold)**
```java
Generate threshold signature addresses by passing in 
all signer public keys and signature thresholds.
Returns: <String>
Return the public key of the threshold-signature address.
Possible error string returned is `Invalid Public Bytes`.
```
**generateControlBlock(pubkeys, threshold, aggPubkey)**
```java
Generate a proof of the aggregated public key by 
passing in the public key and signature threshold of 
all signers and the aggregated public key of everyone 
who performed the signature this time.
Returns: <String>
Return signed proofs for transaction validation.
Possible error string returned is `Invalid Public Bytes`.
```

# Example

The specific usage can be viewed in [ViewController.swift](Musig2Demo/ViewController.swift).This example simulates three people generating aggregated public keys and aggregated signatures firstly. Then including Mast address generation and control block generation.

## Details

## Musig

- First pass in the private key to declare a State pointer and get my pubkey

~~~swift
var round1_state0 = getRound1State(priv: private0)
let pubkey0 = getMyPubkey(priv: private0)
~~~

- Use State pointer to  round1 message.

~~~swift
let round1_msg0 = getRound1Msg(state: round1_state0)
~~~

- Round1 state object serialization

~~~swift
let state_str = encodeRound1State(state: round1_state0);
~~~

- Round1 state object deserialization

~~~swift
round1_state0 = decodeRound1State(round1_state: state_str)
~~~

- Pass the self-generated my_pubkey and round1 message to the other two parties, and the other two parties do the same. In the end, I got the public key and round1 message of the other two parties. Pass in the `getRound2Msg` function to generate my own round2 message. 

~~~swift
let round2_msg0 = getRound2Msg(state: round1_state0, msg: msg, my_pubkey: pubkey0, pubkeys: [pubkey0, pubkey1, pubkey2], received_round1_msg:[round1_msg1, round1_msg2])
~~~

- Pass the round1 message to the other two parties, and I can finally generate the signature by `getAggSignature`. 

~~~swift
let signature = getAggSignature(round2_msg: [round2_msg0, round2_msg1, round2_msg2])
~~~

- When I obtain the public keys of the other two parties, I can generate the aggregate public key. 

~~~swift
let pubkey = getAggPublicKey(pubkeys: [pubkey0, pubkey1, pubkey2])
~~~

## Mast

- The threshold signature address can be generated by using the threshold and the public key of the all participant.

~~~swift
let threshold_pubkey = generateThresholdPubkey(pubkeys: [pubkey0, pubkey1, pubkey2], threshold: 2);
~~~

- Using the threshold, the public keys of all participants and the aggregation of the public keys can generate a proof.

~~~swift
let control_block = generateControlBlock(pubkeys: [pubkey0, pubkey1, pubkey2], threshold: 2, agg_pubkey: pubkey01)
~~~
